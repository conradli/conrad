about: 
  "I am a <b>senior majoring in Computer Science</b> and minoring in Economics at Bowdoin College. I am interested in the intersection between tech and education, specifically providing opportunities for first-gen college students like myself. 

  <br><br>

  For summer 2020, I was a Global Tech Analyst at Bank of America where my team delivered the <b>top three time series prediction models</b> for daily ATM volume estimations out of all intern groups.

  <br><br>
  
  <b>I will graduate in May 2021 and I am interested in full-time job opportunities.</b> I have experience with Python, Java, Kotlin, and HTML/CSS/JS, machine learning models, agile development, and a willingness to learn.
