  description: I created this website for myself to showcase my experience, personal interests, and just for fun! I created and designed this website but I obtained inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/orderedlist">Steve Smith</a> for the layout; <a href="https://github.com/christianezeani">Christian Ezeani</a> for the sidebar; and <a href="https://github.com/jglovier">Joel Glovier</a> for the resume design.

  description: As our final project in Applied Cryptography, we created a local, secure file transfer protocol which used modern day cryptography principles. We used a combination of timestamps, nonces, symmetric key algorithms (AES-GCM mode), and asymmetric key algorithms (RSA) to implement the server machine. We were able to encrypt and upload a photo/file and download the decrypted file only if the user was the owner.
