  description: As our final project in Applied Cryptography, we created a local, secure file transfer protocol which used modern day cryptography principles. We used a combination of timestamps, nonces, symmetric key algorithms (AES-GCM mode), and asymmetric key algorithms (RSA) to implement the server machine. We were able to encrypt and upload a photo/file and download the decrypted file only if the user was the owner.
